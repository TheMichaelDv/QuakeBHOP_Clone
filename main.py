Finally Main game loop XDDD

Basically the tick loop HAS to be separate from frametime so game logic can be run on a diff schedule than frametime
because this allows for unlimited frames and I can set things on a linear time scale. In addition, if a player lags, the game will still be logical.

However I need to implement the running of the render function differently than what the module initally offers. 
I cannot modify the module itself as it will not update on your machine.
Its copy and pasted from moderngl_window.__init__.run_window_config()

Also cleaned up directories and files, wanted to do that forever. Branched as OLD so if you want 

FYI texturecube.py cannot be ran anymore run this file instead to execute texturecube.py

Problem: I am still limited by lag. The solution is to implement async processing.

My idea is to send Matrixs to the other process and then move them over here. Therefore We are not updating the positions every frame but whatever time we set in the other process.

Examples:
Render Process | Logic Process
Init()         | Init()
Waits()        | Sends first matrix
Renders Matrixs| 
Renders Matrixs|
Renders Matrixs| Sends next Matrix
Renders NEW Maxtrix|

As you can see the 2 frames since the last update, the render function renders the old matrix
The benefit of this is that if it lags, logic is not interuptted. Basically its client/server relationship
Also if the physics engine takes too long to process, the client will not see it in their frames but rather the delay of object processing.

For now however, I uncapped the framerates, so we are not vsync limited.
I will be giving the game 144 fps and leaving the rest to the logic engine.

SOLVED: A major problem I'm having is timing. If the game goes as fast as possible, then how to get the computer to sleep for about 10-15 milliseconds or less? time.sleep() is NOT accurate

Need to have two sleep functions, one to test if a conditon is met, 0.02s and one to test if 0.007s is met || gonna step around this issue by implmenting multi
